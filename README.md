## What is reCAPTCHA?

> reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects your site from spam and abuse. It uses advanced risk analysis engine to tell humans and bots apart.
With the new API, a significant number of your valid human users will pass the reCAPTCHA challenge without having to solve a CAPTCHA.
reCAPTCHA comes in the form of a widget that you can easily add to your blog, forum, registration form, etc.
